# Sales Intelligence Dashboard – Geographic, Customer & Product Performance Analysis

This portfolio project uses synthetic data designed to replicate a real-world business environment (fictional company "Plant Co."). The dataset models transactional sales activity across customers, products, and geographic locations, enabling end-to-end analysis of commercial performance, customer behavior, product portfolio effectiveness, and sales trends. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to discover performance drivers, identify growth opportunities, and highlight areas of underperformance across markets and customer segments. This project is produced in its entirety solely using MS Power BI.
